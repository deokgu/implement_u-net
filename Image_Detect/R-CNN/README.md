## 2. Object detection wich R-CNN

``` TEXT
Our object detection system consists of three modules.
The first generates category-independent region proposals. These proposals define the set of candidate detections available to our detector. 
The second module is a large convolutional neural network that extracts a fixed-length feature vector from each region.
The third module is a set of classspecific linear SVMs.
